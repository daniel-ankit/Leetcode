# Nearest Perfect Square
## Easy
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:20px">Given a number N. Find out the nearest number which is a perfect square and also the absolute difference between them.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Example 1:</span></strong></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Input:</strong>
N = 25
<strong>Output:</strong>
25 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Since 25 is a perfect square, it is the 
closest perfect square to itself and 
absolute difference is 25-25=0.</span></pre>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Example 2:</span></strong></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Input:</strong>
N = 1500
<strong>Output:</strong>
1521 21
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Two of the closest perfect squares to 
1521 are 1444.Thus, 1521 is the closest 
perfect square to 1500 and the absolute 
difference  between them is 1521-1500=21.</span></pre>
