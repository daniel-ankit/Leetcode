## Hard
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">There are <strong>N</strong> buildings in Linear Land. They appear in a linear line one after the other and their heights are given in the array <strong>arr[]</strong>. Geek wants to select <strong>three</strong> buildings in Linear Land and remodel them as recreational spots. The third of the selected building must be taller than the first and shorter than the second.<br>
Can geek build the three-building recreational zone?&nbsp;</span></p>

arr[] = {4, 7, 11, 5, 13, 2}
<strong>Output:</strong>
